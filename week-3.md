## Assignments

### Research/Personalize your Development Environment

> Research and update your personal development setup to optimize your workflow

- **Time**: 2:00h
- **Due**: before week 4

You can theoretically write code in about anything that will allow you to write
text. That being said, your choice of tooling greatly affects your productivity.
Development software comes in all shapes and sizes, from basic text-editors to
full blown [IDEs](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide). Besides
editors, there's numerous tools available that'll help you cleanup your code,
like linters, beautifiers, and (type-)checkers.

Research the world of development tooling, and document the research in your
wiki. Look into the following subjects, and describe why you think it's useful
(or not) and if/how you're using it in your own work:

- Text Editors (f.e. Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Atom, Brackets, etc)
- Linters (f.e. JSHint, ESLint, standardJS)
- Code Formatters (f.e. Prettier, Beautifier)

_Pro Tip™_: The latter two are often available as extensions in text-editors.
Research text-editors first, before moving on to other tooling.

### Code Cleanup

> Ensure your code (and repo in general) is neat-o

- **Time**: 30m-3h (depending on your work so far)
- **Due**: before week 4

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write
> code that humans can understand.

The code you write will be _executed_ by computers, but it will exclusively be
_read_ by humans. Therefore, it's critical that your code is easy to read,
understand, and "mentally parse". Go back into your work so far and make sure
that everything you've done so far is easy to understand for "outsiders" to your
project.

_Pro Tip™_: It can be surprisingly difficult to find problems in work you're too
familiar with. Ask a friend to briefly look at your work, and optimize your code
based on the questions they ask.
