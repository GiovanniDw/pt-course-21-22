## Grading

| Task                            | Weight   |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| [Assessment 1][a1] (individual) | 60%      |
| [Assessment 2][a2] (team)       | 40%      |
| **Total**                       | **100%** |


```js
if (!a1 && !a2) {
  grade = 'GR'
} else if (a1 < 5.5 || a2 < 5.5) {
  grade = 1
} else {
  grade = (a1 * 0.6) + (a2 * 0.4)
}
```

> You can find your feedback and final calculated grade in Brightspace under `administration > grades`.

## Goals

The main goals in this course:

* You can design and develop a dynamic matching web application
* You can use version control using Git and GitHub
* You can navigate the terminal and set-up your own development environment
* You can write documentation that other developers understand
* You can explain your code and the cohesion of your application
* You can recognise good quality code, collaborate and review other people's code

## Assessments

### A1 - Feature (Individual)
This is an *oral test* where you individually present the **research (wiki) and feature you created** for project-tech. You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

The first part of the project you will work individually on a job story. You will do research on existing dating apps and come up with a job story. You then start sketching and designing the components within your job story. You end with a working feature of also applying knowledge and skills acquired in back-end and front-end.

Meanwhile you research code standards, code styles, how to setup a local development environment, how to setup a repository on Github and finally researching recent trends within the field of web development.

### A2 - Application (Team)
This is an *oral test* where you **present your prototype with your team**. You will show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project.

In the second part of the project, you will create a team of 3 students and combine your job stories into one complete dating app.

It is important that your team makes decisions together based on consensus. And that everyone applies knowledge and skills acquired in backend and frontend. To illustrate, this means every team member works with templates. Not that one person does CSS and the person with pre-existing knowledge the whole backend. So split work per feature (such as liking) instead of per area (such as templating).

You will use Git and Github to have version control on your code. You will agree upon code standards and coding style. You will review code of others and will process pull requests from other developers yourself. You will document the project.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. We report it to our assessment committee
([examencommissie](https://moodle.cmd.hva.nl/mod/page/view.php?id=1738) in Dutch). For more on plagiarism read our [_statement of academic integrity_](https://github.com/cmda-bt/be-course-20-21/blob/main/docs/plagiarism.md).


## Publishing
Grades will be published and communicated in _Brightspace_ and/or _MS Teams_. We also publish grade lists on _Brightspace_ based on student numbers.

* Final grades will be **published** ~_one week_ after test date.
* Final grades will be put in **SIS** ~_two weeks_ after test date.

> After the first oral test you can request **viewing time** for additional feedback, this can be useful for a resit. Feel free to [contact your lecturer trough _MS Teams_](/readme#synopsis) if you want to do so.
