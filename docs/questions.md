## Questions

Asking good questions is a skill. Here are a few tips and resources to help you formulate your question more clearly. 

* [No Hello][hello]

> Imagine calling someone on the phone, going hello! then putting them on hold...

* [Don't ask to ask, just ask][ask]

> "Any Java experts around?", but rather ask "How do I do [problem] with Java and [other relevant info]?"

* [How do I ask a good question?][improve]

> Often beginners don’t ask clear questions, or ask questions that don’t have the necessary information to answer the questions

## Examples

If you have technical questions feel free to ask them on MS Teams. It's helpful if you include examples.

* Don't use screenshots but link to specific files or snippets in your repo.
* Let teachers and other students know which solutions you've already tried.
* Ask questions in the general channels instead of direct messaging teachers and students. Other students might have encountered the same problem and found a solution.

* [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example][example]

> When asking a question, people will be better able to provide help if you provide code that they can easily understand and use to reproduce the problems.

## Tech shaming

If you're answering a question of your fellow student, **never ever tech shame**. Never write a snobby put down of someones technical ability or inferior knowledge for not using or knowing about a piece of technology. **Teachers will enforce our code of conduct on MS Teams.**
